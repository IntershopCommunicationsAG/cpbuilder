Classpath Builder
==================
This tool helps to create a classpath from differen project folders for
complex java projects.

Usage
-----
It is possible to configure the project directory, the path of  
subproject jar files  and a list of excluded project directories.
Directories with a dot as the first character in the name are not included.

```shell script
Usage of cpbuilder:
  -dir string
        Directory with projects / cartridges
  -excludes string
        String with excluded directories
  -path string
        Sub path with jar file
```

It is also possible to configure the exclude list or the library path
over environment variables.

| Name           | Description                           | Example          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| `LIBPATH`      | Path with jar files                   | build/libs       |
| `PATHEXCLUDES` | List with exluded project directories | build,config,bin |

Example
-------
Project structure
```
/user/name/project
   |- .gradle
   |- bin
   |- build
   |- subprj1
   |- subprj2
   |- gradle
   |- build.gradle
   ...
```

Skript
```shell script
export PATHEXCLUDES="bin,build,gradle"
CLASSPATH=`cpbuilder -dir /user/name/project -path target/libs

echo $CLASSPATH
```

Result
```
/user/name/project/subprj1/target/libs/*:/user/name/project/subprj2/target/libs/*
```
